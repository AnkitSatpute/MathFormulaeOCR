\section{Introduction}
Let us recall the setting of \cite{LW}. We take a Gaussian $g_\Omega(t):=\overline{e^{\pi it^T\Omega t}}$, where $\Omega\in \mathfrak{h}$ is an element of the Siegel upper half space
$$
\mathfrak{h}:=\{\Omega\in \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb C): \Omega = \Omega^T,\, \mathrm{Im}\,\Omega \text{ is positive definite}\},
$$
a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb R^{2n}$, and associate to these the Gaussian Gabor system $\{\pi_\lambda g_\Omega\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ as
$$
\pi_\lambda g_\Omega(t):=e^{2\pi i \xi^Tt}g_\Omega(t-x),\quad \lambda = (\xi,x)\in \Lambda, \quad\xi^Tt:=\sum\limits_{j=1}^n\xi_jt_j.
$$
Then $\{\pi_\lambda g_\Omega\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ is called a Gaussian Gabor frame if there exist constants $A,B>0$ such that
$$
A\|f\|^2\le\sum\limits_{\lambda\in \Lambda}|(f,\pi_\lambda g_\Omega)|^2\le B\|f\|^2 \quad \text{for } f\in L^2(\mathbb R^{n}),
$$
where$(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the $L^2$ inner product.

Multivariate Gaussian Gabor frames have recently been investigated by the first and the last author of this note \cite[Thm. 1.1]{LW}, where a density condition for a certain class of Gaussian Gabor frames is formulated for transcendental lattices $\Lambda$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Recall that a lattice $\Gamma$ in $\mathbb C^n$ is said to be transcendental if the complex  torus $X:=\mathbb C^n/\Gamma$ is Campana simple, i.e. the only positive dimensional analytic subvariety of $X$ is $X$ itself.

In \cite{RUZ} density conditions for bivariate Gaussian Gabor frames for product lattices are established by relating Gabor systems as elements of a quasi-shift invariant space of functions. An almost complete description of lattices that have Gaussian Gabor frames is given in \cite{RUZ}, except for lattices given by an irrational rotation. 

By our reformulation of \cite[Thm. 1.1]{LW} in purely combinatorial terms for the lattice we are able to close this gap in \cite{RUZ} and we will also demonstrate that this density criterion is a generic property.

\section{A Density Criterion for Gaussian Gabor Frames}

We want to give an equivalent condition on lattices $\Lambda\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ that give Gaussian Gabor frames $(g_\Omega,\Lambda)$.
By Proposition 1.4 in \cite{LW}, it suffices to look at the $\Omega=i I$ case, i.e.
$$
g_\Omega(t)=e^{-\pi|t|^2}.
$$
In this case, by the Bargmann transform, we know that $(e^{-\pi|t|^2}, \Lambda)$ is a Gabor frame for $L^2(\mathbb R^n)$ if and only if 
$$
\Lambda_{\mathbb C}:=\{\xi+ix \in \mathbb C^n: (\xi, x)\in \Lambda\}
$$
defines a frame for the classical Bargmann-Fock space.  Hence, by \cite[Prop. 2.1]{GL} we have the following fact:

\begin{proposition}\label{pr:GL} $(e^{-\pi|t|^2}, \Lambda)$ is a Gabor frame for $L^2(\mathbb R^n)$ if and only if $\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ is a set of uniqueness for $\mathcal F^\infty$, i.e. if for every  holomorphic function $F$ on $\mathbb C^n$ we have  
$$
\sup_{z\in \mathbb C^n} |F(z)|^2 e^{-\pi|z|^2}\le1 \ \ \text{and} \ \ F|_{\Lambda_\mathbb C} =0,
$$
then $F\equiv 0$ on $\mathbb C^n$.
\end{proposition}
On the other hand, one may use K\"ahler geometry methods to prove the following result.

\begin{proposition}\label{pr:GL1} If $\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ is not a set of uniqueness for $\mathcal F^\infty$ and $\mathbb C^n/\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ has no analytic subvariety of dimension $1\leq d< n$ then $|\Lambda| \geq 1/n!$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} If $\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ is not a set of uniqueness for $\mathcal F^\infty$,  then the following $\omega$-pluri-subharmonic function (PSH)
$$
G(z):=\sup^*\left\lbrace \log(|F(z)|^2 e^{-\pi|z|^2}): F\in \mathcal O(\mathbb C^n), \sup_{z\in \mathbb C^n} |F(z)|^2 e^{-\pi|z|^2}=1, \ F|_{\Lambda_\mathbb C} =0\right\rbrace
$$
is not identically equal to $-\infty$, where $\mathcal O(\mathbb C^n)$ denotes the space of holomorphic functions on $\mathbb C^n$, $\sup^*$ denotes the upper semicontinuous regularization of the supremum and by $\omega$-PSH we mean that $G$ is an upper semicontinuous function with $dd^cG +\omega\ge 0$, and $\omega$ is the standard K\"ahler form on $\mathbb C^n$. 
\\~\\
Note that $G$ is $\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$-invariant. 
\\~\\
To see this, consider a point $z \in \mathbb{C}^n$, a lattice point $\lambda \in \Lambda_\mathbb{C}$, and a holomorphic function $F$ which is a suitable candidate for $G$. Then we have
$$
|F(z+\lambda)|^2e^{-\pi|z+\lambda|^2}= |F(z+\lambda)e^{-\pi z\overline{\lambda}-\frac{\pi|\lambda|^2}{2}}|^2e^{-\pi |z|^2}.
$$
Let us define
$$
\tilde{F}(z):= F(z+\lambda)e^{-\pi z\overline{\lambda}-\frac{\pi|\lambda|^2}{2}},
$$
we have that $\tilde{F}$ is also a candidate for $G$. This means that $G(z)$ is no less than $G(z+\lambda)$, implying $\Lambda_\mathbb C$-invariance.

As such, we now consider $G$ as a function on the torus $\mathbb C^n/\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$. We clearly have that $dd^cG(z)$ is bounded from below by $-\omega$, meaning we may use the approximation result of Demailly for quasi-psh functions (\cite[Proposition 3.7]{Dem92}) to find a sequence of quasi-PSH functions $(G_m)_m$ which converge to $G$, such that $G_m>G$, have only analytic singularities, and fulfill the estimate:

$$
\nu_x(G)-\frac{n}{m}\leq \nu_x(G_m) \leq \nu_x(G),\; x \in \mathbb C^n/\Lambda_{\mathbb C}
$$
for the Lelong numbers of $G$ and $G_m$. We have the estimate for $G_m$
$$
dd^cG_m \geq -(1+\varepsilon_m)\omega,
$$
for some sequence of numbers $(\varepsilon_m)_m$ which decreases to $0$.
\\~~\\
 Assume now that $\mathbb C^n/\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ has no analytic subvariety of dimension $1\leq d< n$. This then implies that the singularities of the $G_m$ must be isolated. Thus we can bound the Seshadri constant of $\mathbb C^n/\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ from below by the Lelong numbers of $\frac{G_m}{1+\varepsilon_m}$  at the point corresponding to the origin.  Since these are bounded from below by $\frac{1-{(n/m)}}{1+\varepsilon_m}$, taking the limit as $m$ approaches infinity, we have that the Seshadri constant of $\mathbb C^n/\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ is no less than one.  Demailly's mass concentration trick also implies that (see \cite[Theorem 2.8]{Tosatti1}) this bound on the Seshadri constant is equivalent to $|\Lambda| \geq 1/n!$.
\end{proof}

To check that $\mathbb C^n/\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ has no analytic subvariety of dimension $1\leq d< n$ we need the following result (the proof follows directly from the argument in page 164-165 in \cite[pp.164-165]{Sha}).

\begin{lemma}\label{le:sha} Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in $\mathbb C^n$. Assume that the following linear mapping from singular homology to functionals on Dolbeault cohomology
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sha}
{\rm int}_\Gamma: \oplus_{1\leq k< n} H_{2k} (\mathbb C^n/\Gamma, \mathbb Z) \to \oplus_{p+q=2k, \,1\leq k< n, \,p>q\geq 0} (H^{p,q} (\mathbb C^n/\Gamma, \mathbb C))^*
\end{equation}
defined by
$$
{\rm int}_\Gamma(S)(\alpha):=\int_S \alpha
$$
is injective. Then $\mathbb C^n/\Gamma$ has no analytic subvariety of dimension $1\leq d< n$.
\end{lemma}

Let us give a more elementary description of this condition. The lattice $\Gamma$ is given by
$$
\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}e_1 + ... + \mathbb{Z}e_{2n},
$$
where $e_1,...,e_{2n}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ are vectors which are linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$. In this case, the homology groups $H_{2k} (\mathbb C^n/\Gamma, \mathbb Z)$ have bases over $\mathbb Z$ given by
$$
S_i := \pi(\mathbb R e_{i_1} + ... + \mathbb R e_{i_{2k}}),
$$
for the multi-index $i=(i_1,...,i_{2k}) \in \mathbb N ^{2k}$ with $i_j<i_l$ for $j<l$. (For the sake of convenience we will denote the set of such indices by $I_k$). Observe that the map $\pi$ is a projection from $\mathbb C^n$ onto the complex torus $X$. As such, we may now write any cycle $S \in H_{2k} (\mathbb C^n/\Gamma, \mathbb Z)$ as 
$$
S=\sum\limits_{i\in I_k} a_iS_i,
$$
for some integers $a_i$. This fact should also help explain the singular homology groups on the Torus for those who are unfamiliar: $H_{2k}(\mathbb C^n/\Gamma,\mathbb Z)$ can be thought of as the free Abelian group over the closed "curves" of real dimension $2k$ (modulo some equivalence relation which will not be relevant in what follows). Now, for a $(p,q)$-form $\alpha$, where $p+q=k$ and $p>q\geq0$, we have that 
$$
 {\rm int}_\Gamma(S)(\alpha) = \sum\limits_{i\in I_k}a_i\int_{S_i}\alpha.
$$
Hence the injectivity of ${\rm int}_\Gamma(S)$ is equivalent to the following statement: 
\\~\\
If for every closed $(p,q)$ form $\alpha$, where $p+q=k$, $p>q\geq0$ ${\rm int}_\Gamma(S)(\alpha)=0$, the numbers $a_i$ must all be 0. The reader should of course note that this condition must also be checked for every $k$ less than $n$. Furthermore,  by linearity  it  suffices to check this condition on a a basis of $H^{p,q}(\mathbb C^n / \Gamma,\mathbb C)$.
\\~\\
We now turn to the case where $n=2$. Hence we need only to check the case $k=1$, which also forces $p=2$ and $q=0$. Additionally, the $(2,0)$ forms are spanned by the single form induced by $dz_1\wedge dz_2$. As such, the condition that ${\rm int}_\Gamma(S)(\alpha)$ is injective can be expressed as the condition that the numbers
$$
\int_{S_i}\pi_*(dz_1\wedge dz_2)
$$
are linearly independent over $\mathbb Z$. Explicitly computing these integrals gives the following result:

\medskip

\noindent
\textbf{Remark.}  \emph{In case $n=2$ and $\Gamma$ generated by
$e_j=(\alpha_j, \beta_j)$, $1\leq j\leq 4$, over $\mathbb Z$, then \cite[p.165]{Sha} tells us that $\ker {\rm int}_\Gamma=0$ if and only if 
$$
\alpha_j\beta_k-\alpha_k\beta_j, \ \\ 1\leq j<k\leq 4,
$$
are linearly independent over $\mathbb Z$. }

\medskip

For $n>2$, we have way more conditions. When we examine the case $k>1$, we must not only look at the group $H^{2k,0} (\mathbb C^2/\Gamma, \mathbb C)$, but also  the groups $H^{2k-1,1} (\mathbb C^2/\Gamma, \mathbb C)$ and so on. The group $H^{p,q} (\mathbb C^2/\Gamma, \mathbb C)$ has a basis given by the forms
$$
\pi_*(dz_P\wedge d\overline{z}_Q), \; P\in\mathbb N^p,Q\in\mathbb N^q,
$$
when we take $P$ and $Q$ to be ascending. We can compute the integrals
$$
\int_{S_i}\pi_*(dz_P\wedge d\overline{z}_Q)
$$
in a manner similar to the one which gives us the statement in the previous remark, and see that these are the numbers
$$
C^i_{P,Q}:=\mathrm{det}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
e_{i_1,P_1}&...&e_{i_1,P_p} &\overline{e}_{i_1,Q_1}&...&\overline{e}_{i_1,Q_q}\\
.& & & & &.\\
.& & & & &.\\
.& & & & &.\\
e_{i_{2k},P_1}&...&e_{i_{2k},P_p} &\overline{e}_{i_{2k},Q_1}&...&\overline{e}_{i_{2k},Q_q}
\end{matrix}
\right).
$$
We may now reformulate our criterion for the nonexistence of subvarieties of the complex torus in the following way.

\begin{lemma}
We have $\rm{ker}$ $\rm int_{\Gamma} =0$ if and only if for every $0<k<n$ there exists no set of integers $\{a_i\}_{i\in I_k} \subseteq \mathbb Z$ not all equal to $0$ such that for all ascending multi-indices $P,Q$ where $(P,Q)\in \mathbb N^{2k}$ and $P$ has more entries than $Q$,
$$
\sum\limits_{i\in I_k}a_iC^i_{P,Q}=0.
$$
\end{lemma}

This immediately give the following sufficient criterion which may be easier to check than the original condition. 

\begin{corollary}
$\rm{ker} \,\rm int_{\Gamma} =0$ if for every $0<k<n$ there exist multi-indices $P,Q$ where $(P,Q)\in \mathbb N^{2k}$ and $P$ has more entries than $Q$ are such that the numbers $\{C^i_{P,Q}\}_{i\in I_k}$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb Z$.
\end{corollary}

In general,  Lemma \ref{le:sha} gives the following explicit version of \cite[Thm 1.1]{LW}.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:extra} $(e^{-\pi|t|^2}, \Lambda)$ is a Gabor frame for $L^2(\mathbb R^n)$ if one of the following assumptions holds: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] $|\Lambda| <\frac1{n!}$ and $\ker {\rm int}_{\Lambda_{\mathbb C}} =0$, where
$$
\Lambda_{\mathbb C}:=\{\xi+ix \in \mathbb C^n: (\xi, x)\in \Lambda\}.
$$
\item[(2)] $|\Lambda| <\frac{n!}{n^n}$ and $\ker {\rm int}_{\Lambda^\circ_{\mathbb C}} =0$, where
$$
\Lambda^\circ_{\mathbb C}:=\{\eta+iy \in \mathbb C^n: \xi^T y -x^T\eta \in \mathbb Z, \ \forall\  (\xi,x) \in \Lambda\}.
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\noindent
\textbf{Remark.}  \emph{Almost all lattices in $\mathbb R^{2n}$ satisfy $\ker {\rm int}_{\Lambda_{\mathbb C}} =0$ and $\ker {\rm int}_{\Lambda^\circ_{\mathbb C}} =0$ (as we will show later on), hence the above theorem gives an effective Gabor frame criterion in terms of the covolume for almost all lattices. }

\noindent
\begin{corollary}
In case $\Lambda = \mathbb Z^2 \times A \mathbb Z^2$, where $A$ is a real linear mapping defined by
$$
A(x,y):=(ax+by, cx+dy),
$$
then we have that 
$$
\ker {\rm int}_{\Lambda_{\mathbb C}} =0 \Leftrightarrow\ker {\rm int}_{\Lambda^\circ_{\mathbb C}} =0 \Leftrightarrow ad-bc \notin \mathbb Q, \ a,b,c,d \, \text{are $\mathbb Z$-linearly independent.} 
$$
Such a lattice then induces a Gabor frame if additionally, $|ad-bc|<\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the examples in Theorem 1.5 in \cite{RUZ} do not satisfy our assumptions and need not generate Gabor frames for $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    In this case the complexified  lattice $\Lambda_{\mathbb C}$ is generated by the vectors
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1\\
            0
        \end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix}
            0\\
            1
        \end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix}
            ia\\
            ic
        \end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix}
            ib\\
            id
        \end{pmatrix}.
    \end{align*}
    We may now apply the two dimensional version of our criterion for a transcendental lattice which was given in an earlier remark to see that $\Lambda$ is transcendental precisely when the determinants $1$, $bc-ad$, $ia$, $ib$, $ic$, and $id$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb Z$. This happens precisely when the condition given in the statement of the Lemma is fulfilled. The case of the symplectic dual can be verified in the same way.
\end{proof}

\medskip

We will now prove the following genericity result:
\begin{theorem}
Transcendental tori are generic with respect to the choice of the lattice.
\end{theorem} 
We will first clarify what we mean by generic.  Consider the fact that the space of lattices is equal to the space $\mathrm{Gl}(2n,\mathbb R)/\mathrm{Gl}(2n,\mathbb Z)$. We say that a property is generic for lattices if there exists an $S\subsetneq \mathrm{Gl}(2n,\mathbb R)$,  which is a set of Lebesgue measure zero in $\mathbb R^{4n^2}$ such that the property is fulfilled by all lattices in $(\mathrm{Gl}(2n,\mathbb R)\setminus S)/\mathrm{Gl}(2n,\mathbb Z)$.
\begin{proof}
Consider any set of integers $\{a_i\}_{i\in I_k}$. Then the equations
$$
\sum\limits_{i\in I_k}a_iC^i_{P,Q}=0
$$
induce a closed variety in $\mathbb R^{4n^2}.$ It is sufficient to prove that a variety of this form has codimension of at least 1 for some given $(P,Q)$, as this will imply that the variety in this case is of Lebesgue measure zero , and the set in $\mathbb R^{4n^2}$ which does not induce a transcendental torus must be contained within this union. This is a simple observation to make since all we must show is that there is a point which does not lie in this subvariety. 

\smallskip

To see this,  observe in the case $2k\leq n$,  and choose $P$ to be of length $2k$ and $Q$ an empty multiindex. Then the polynomials $C^i_{P,Q}$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb R[e_{1,1},...,e_{2n,n}]$. 

\smallskip

We see this by looking at the "first term" of the $C^i_{P,Q}.$ By this, we mean the summand in the determinant which is given by multiplying the elements on the main diagonal.  So this term will be of the form
$$
e_{i_1,P_1}\cdot...\cdot e_{i_{2k},P_{2k}}.
$$
If we now choose a different index $j\in I_k$. Without loss of generality we may assume that the number $i_1$ does not occur in $j$.  This means that the variable $e_{i_1P_1}$ also cannot occur in $C^j_{P,Q}$, making $C^j_{P,Q}$ linearly independent from $C^i_{P,Q}$. Thus, nontrivial linear combinations of the $C^i_{P,Q}$ cannot vanish identically. 

\smallskip

Now observe the case where $2k>n$. We now take $P=(1,2,...n)$, and $Q$ to be of length $2k-n$. We need to check that the corresponding polynomials $C^i_{P,Q}$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb R[e_{1,1}, \bar e_{1,1}, ..,e_{2n,n}, \bar e_{2n, n}]$. 

\smallskip

Once again, this follows from that the term given by multiplying the elements of the diagonal, $e_{i_1,1}\cdot...\cdot e_{i_n,n}\cdot \overline{e}_{i_{n+1},Q_1}\cdot...\cdot \overline{e}_{i_{2k},Q_{2k-n}}
$
is unique with respect to $i$. 

\begin{comment}
The difficulty now is that, for example, the variables $e_{i _1,1}$ and $\overline{e}_{i _1,1}$ are not independent from each other. The key here is that $e_{i _1,1}$ and $\overline{e}_{i _1,1}$, are linearly independent polynomials over $\mathbb R$ in terms of their real and imaginary parts.This means that terms like 
$$
e_{i_1,1}\cdot...\cdot e_{i_n,n}\cdot \overline{e}_{i_{n+1}1}\cdot...\cdot \overline{e}_{i_{2k}Q_{2k-n}},
$$
and
$$
e_{i_2,2}\cdot...\cdot e_{i_{n},n}\cdot e_{i_{n+1},1} \cdot \overline{e}_{{i_1}1}\cdot...\cdot \overline{e}_{i_{2k}Q_{2k-n}},
$$
will be linearly independent over $\mathbb R [\Re (e_{1,1}), \Im (e_{1,1}),...,\Im (e_{2n,2n})]$, and thereby the $C^i_{p,Q}$ are as well.
