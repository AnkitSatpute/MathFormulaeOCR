\section{Introduction}
In this note we extend the asymptotic analysis of the minimization of the Ginzburg-Landau energy to the setting of a complex hermitian line bundle $\L$ over a closed two-dimensional surface $\M$. 

When both the connection $1$-form and the section of the bundle are considered as unknowns, this is known as the abelian Higgs model (see \cite{JaffeTaubes}, and \cite{BethuelRiviere}, \cite{Orlandi} for the asymptotic analysis of minimizers).

The minimization with respect to the section only, the connection $1$-form being fixed,  was considered more recently. In \cite{IgnatJerrard}, Ignat and Jerrard  analyze this for the case where $\L$ is the tangent bundle with its Levi-Civita connection, so that a section of $\L$ is a tangent vector field on $\M$. Their analysis carries over straightforwardly to a general bundle equipped with a connection,  as we show. 

Our motivation lies in the context of liquid crystal modeling where one often wishes to capture nonorientable configurations, leading to the consideration of a Ginzburg-Landau type energy defined not on vector fields but rather on so-called $Q$-tensor bundles. In fact, here we consider a more general theory that encompasses higher order symmetric traceless tensor bundles, as we review in Section \ref{sec:high}. These objects have applications in meshing and physics and are discussed in more detail in \cite{MR4572144,MR4315483,10.1145/3366786}.

Specifically, the energy to be studied here is given by
\begin{equation}
E_\e[u]=\frac12\int_{\M}|\nabla_Au|^2+\frac{1}{2\varepsilon^2}{(1-|u|^2)}^2,\label{GLenergy}
\end{equation}
where $\e>0$, $A$ is a connection on $\L$ and $u$ is a section. In Section \ref{linebundles} we provide background on line bundles, connections and sections, but here we point out that locally, such a section $u$ is simply given by its trivialization, which takes the form of a map from an open patch on $\M$ to the complex plane $\C$. 

Going back to the seminal work of Brezis, Bethuel and Helein \cite{BBH}, the central goal in studying minimizers of $E_\e$ is to determine the number and asymptotic location of the singularities that for topological reasons are forced to exist. In the present setting, singularities necessarily emerge when the Euler number of $\L$ is non-zero. In the context of liquid crystals these singularities represent defects whose appearance represent key features of the liquid crystal texture on the surface. As in \cite{BBH} and \cite{IgnatJerrard}, we will characterize the asymptotic location of these singularities as those points on $\M$ minimizing a certain renormalized energy $W$ arising as the $O(1)$ term, following a logarithmic leading term, in an expansion for the minimal energy. An explicit formula for $W$ is given in Proposition \ref{explicit}.

Our main result is the following:
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:1}
Assume that $\L$ is a complex hermitian line bundle over a closed surface $\M$ and $A$ is a connection on $\L$. 
Let $u_\varepsilon$ be a minimizer of $E_\e.$ Then there exist points $a_1,\ldots,a_d$ where $d$ is the absolute value of the Euler number $e(\L)$ such that $u_\e$ converges to $u_*$ in $C^k_{\mathrm{loc}}(\M\backslash\{a_1,\ldots,a_d\})$
as $\eps\to0$ for any $k$, where $u_*$ is a {\em canonical harmonic section}  with singularities of degree one about the points $a_1,\ldots,a_d$ (see definition below).  Furthermore, $E_\eps[u_\eps]=\pi d\log{\frac{1}{\eps}}+d\gamma+W(a_1,\ldots,a_d)+o(1).$ Here, for any collection of points $b_1,\dots,b_d$ on $\M$ we let  $W(b_1,\ldots,b_d)$ be the minimum  of \begin{equation}
    \tilde{E}[v,b_1,\ldots,b_d]:=\lim_{\rho\to0}\left[\frac{1}{2}\int_{\M\backslash\cup_{j=1}^d B_\rho(b_j)}|\nabla_A v|^2+\pi d\log{\rho}\right]\label{Wdefn}
    \end{equation}
over all canonical harmonic sections $v$  with singularities of degree one about the points $b_1,\ldots,b_d$.

The points $(a_1,\ldots,a_d)$ minimize $W$ over $\M^d$ and the section $u_*$ minimizes $\tilde{E}[\cdot,a_1,\ldots,a_d]$ over canonical harmonic sections singular at $a_1,\ldots,a_d$.
\end{thm}

\begin{rmk}
In \cite{IgnatJerrard} there is 
a proof of $\Gamma$-convergence but here we focus only on the limiting behavior of minimizers. This simplifies the proof of the result greatly. However, we do not see any impediment to establishing such a more general result in our setting.
\end{rmk}

A more explicit expression for $u_*$ leading to an explicit formula for $W$ in terms of the Green's function for $\M$ was derived in \cite{IgnatJerrard} for the specific case of the tangent bundle on $\M$. We adapt this procedure to the present, more general case in Section \ref{sec:W}. We then use the general formula for $W$ to specialize the results to bundles of higher rank symmetric traceless tensors in the next theorem. The relevant background is provided in Section \ref{sec:high}.
\begin{thm}\label{tetra}
    If $\M=\mathbb{S}^2$ and $\L$ is the bundle $T^k_{sym, tr}\mathbb S^2$ of symmetric traceless rank $k$ tensors on $\mathbb{S}^2,$ then the number of singularities of the limiting canonical harmonic section is $d=2k$. Moreover, the location of these singularities can be characterized as follows: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $k=2$ then $(a_1,\ldots,a_4)$ lie at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron.
        \item If $k=3$ then $(a_1,\ldots,a_6)$ lie at the vertices of the cross-polytope.
        \item If $k=6$ then $(a_1,\ldots,a_{12})$ lie at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.
    \end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{rmk}
    When $k=2,$ the bundle is precisely that of $Q$-tensors \cite{MR2893657}; thus singularities of a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal on the surface of a sphere form a perfect tetrahedron, as is well known from experimental observations.
\end{rmk}

\section{Background on line bundles}\label{linebundles}
In this section, for the convenience of the reader, we provide some basic background on hermitian line bundles over surfaces, cf. \cite{BottTu, Hall}. To this end, let $\M$ be a surface. We let $\{U_\alpha\}_\alpha$ be a {\em simple} cover of $\M,$ i.e., a cover of $\M$ by simply connected open patches such that any intersection $U_{\alpha\beta} = U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ or  $U_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = U_\alpha\cap U_\beta\cap U_\gamma$ is simply connected as well. Then  a complex line bundle $\L$ over $\M$ is defined by transition functions $\varphi_{\alpha\beta}:U_{\alpha\beta}\to\mR $ satisfying the condition that $\varphi_{\alpha\beta} + \varphi_{\beta\gamma} + \varphi_{\gamma\alpha}$ defined on $U_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ is $2\pi\mZ$-valued.

A {\em section} $u$ of $\L$ is defined by its trivializations 
$\{u_\alpha\}_\alpha$
which are maps $$u_\alpha:U_\alpha\to \mC $$ such that $u_\alpha = e^{i\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} u_\beta$ on $U_{\alpha\beta}$. If we further choose local coordinates on $U_\alpha$, then we can view $u_\alpha$ as a map from an open subset of $\mR^2$ to $\mC$.
Notice that we can define an inner product between two sections $u$ and $v$ using the complex structure of the trivializations on $U_\alpha$, i.e.
$\langle u_\alpha,v_\alpha\rangle=\bar{v}_\alpha u_\alpha$, and this inner product is independent of $\alpha$.

A {\em connection} $A$ on $\L$ is defined by a set of real-valued 1-forms $\{A_\alpha\}_\alpha$, where $A_\alpha$ is defined on $U_\alpha$ and where 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:conn}
    A_\alpha = A_\beta + d\varphi_{\alpha\beta}
\end{equation}
on $U_{\alpha\beta}$.

The {\em covariant derivative} of a section $u$ relative to the connection $A$ in the direction of the tangent field $\tau$ is a section denoted $\partial_\tau^A u$ and defined by its trivializations
\begin{equation}\label{covdev}(\partial_\tau^A u)_\alpha = \tau\cdot u_\alpha - i A_\alpha(\tau) u_\alpha,\end{equation}
where $\tau\cdot u_\alpha$ is the derivative of the complex-valued function $u_\alpha$ in the direction $\tau$. Note that we have
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
  (\partial_\tau^A u)_\alpha &= \tau\cdot (e^{i\varphi_{\alpha\beta}}u_\beta) -  i \left(A_\beta + d\varphi_{\alpha\beta}\right)(\tau) e^{i\varphi_{\alpha\beta}}u_\beta\\
  &= e^{i\varphi_{\alpha\beta}}\left( \tau\cdot u_\beta - iA_\beta(\tau) u_\beta + id\varphi_{\alpha\beta}(\tau) u_\beta - id\varphi_{\alpha\beta}(\tau) u_\beta\right)\\
  &= e^{i\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} (\partial_\tau^A u)_\beta,\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
so that this indeed defines a section of the bundle.
We denote by $d_A u$ the map $\tau \to \partial_\tau^A u$.

The two-form $dA$ is globally defined since $dA_\alpha = dA_\beta$ on $U_{\alpha\beta}$. It is called the {\em curvature} 2-form and $\kappa = *dA$ is the {\em curvature} of the connection $A$.

Next, given points $\{b_1,\ldots,b_d\}\subset\M,$ we specialize to the case of a smooth section $v$ of modulus $1$ defined on $\M\setminus\{b_1,\ldots,b_d\}$. It has trivializations $v_\alpha,$ where $v_\alpha:U_\alpha\backslash\{b_1,\ldots,b_d\}\to\mathbb{S}^1.$ If we denote by $\theta_\alpha$ a local lifting of $v_\alpha$ then the covariant derivative of $v$, as given by \eqref{covdev} can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coder}
    \left(d^Av\right)_\alpha=i\left(d\theta_\alpha-A_\alpha\right)v_\alpha.
\end{equation}
Since $d\theta_\alpha-A_\alpha=d\theta_\beta-A_\beta$ on $U_{\alpha\beta},$ this real-valued 1-form is globally defined on $\M\backslash\{b_1,\ldots,b_d\}.$ We conclude that to each such section $v$ there corresponds a one-form that can be simply written as $d\theta-A.$ 

\section{Canonical harmonic sections}
Before computing the renormalized energy, we need to introduce and describe the properties of {\em canonical harmonic sections}.

\begin{definition} Following \cite{IgnatJerrard} we define a canonical harmonic section with singularities at $b_1,\dots,b_d$ to be a smooth section of modulus $1$ on $\M\setminus\{b_1,\ldots,b_d\}$ with degree $+1$ about each of the singularities, and such that the corresponding globally defined form $\omega :=d\theta-A$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{canonical}d\omega = 2\pi\left(\sum_{j=1}^d\delta_{b_j}\right) d\vol - dA,\quad d^*\omega = 0.\end{equation}
\end{definition}
We now describe the set of these canonical harmonic one-forms. 
First, we have:
\begin{lem} A smooth section of modulus $1$ on $\M\setminus\{b_1,\ldots,b_d\}$ with degree $+1$ about each of the singularities exists iff $d = e(\L)$. 
\end{lem} 
\begin{proof} For the necessity of the condition $d = e(\L)$, see for instance \cite{BottTu}, Theorem 11.16. 

We sketch the proof that this condition is also sufficient. Assume $d = e(\L)$ and $b_1,\dots,b_d$ are distinct points in $\M$. Let $\psi_{b,d}$ be any solution to the equation
\begin{equation}\label{psibd}-\Delta \psi_{b,d}=2\pi\sum_{j=1}^d\delta_{b_j}-*dA,\quad \int_\M\psi_{b,d}=0.\end{equation} 
(In contrast to \cite{IgnatJerrard}, we will view $\psi_{b,d}$ as a function rather than as a two-form.)
 Since $d = e(\L)$,  the integral over $\M$ of the right-hand side is zero and therefore such a solution exists. Then $\omega = *d\psi_{b,d}$ satisfies 
 $$d\omega = 2\pi\left(\sum_{j=1}^d\delta_{b_j}\right) d\vol - dA,$$
 so that if we define $\theta_\alpha$ to be such that $d\theta_\alpha = \omega + A_\alpha$, then $e^{i\theta_\alpha}$ is well defined on $U_\alpha\setminus\{b_1,\ldots,b_d\}$ and has a singularity of degree one at each $b_k\in U_\alpha$.

Moreover, $d(\theta_\beta - \theta_\alpha - \phi_{\alpha\beta}) = 0$ for any $\alpha$, $\beta$, so that there exist constants $c_{\alpha\beta}$ such that $\theta_\beta - \theta_\alpha - \phi_{\alpha\beta} = c_{\alpha\beta}$. Note that each $\theta_\alpha$ is only defined modulo $2\pi$ due to the presence of singularities, but $\theta_\beta - \theta_\alpha$ is a well-defined function on $U_{\alpha\beta}$. 

From the definition of $c_{\alpha\beta}$, we have that 
$\varepsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma} := c_{\alpha\beta} + c_{\beta\gamma}+c_{\gamma\alpha} $ belongs to $2\pi\mZ$ for any $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$. Therefore there exists $\tilde c_{\alpha\beta},\tilde c_{\beta\gamma},\tilde c_{\gamma\alpha}\in 2\pi\mZ$ such that 
$\varepsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = {\tilde c}_{\alpha\beta} + {\tilde c}_{\beta\gamma}+{\tilde c}_{\gamma\alpha}$. 
Then $\sigma_{\alpha\beta} := c_{\alpha\beta} - {\tilde c}_{\alpha\beta}$ satisfies 
$\sigma_{\alpha\beta} + \sigma_{\beta\gamma}+\sigma_{\gamma\alpha} = 0$. Therefore there exists functions $f_\alpha:U_\alpha\to \mR$ such that
$\sigma_{\alpha\beta} = f_\beta - f_\alpha$, for any $\alpha$, $\beta$. Then we let ${\tilde\theta}_\alpha = \theta_\alpha - f_\alpha$, so that  
$${\tilde\theta}_\beta - {\tilde\theta}_\alpha - \phi_{\alpha\beta} = {\tilde c}_{\alpha\beta},$$
hence $e^{i\tilde\theta_\beta} = e^{i\tilde\theta_\alpha}e^{i\phi_{\alpha\beta}}$ and therefore $\{e^{i{\tilde\theta}_\alpha}\}$ defines a global section of the bundle.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
    The section $u_0$ constructed in the above lemma has the following behavior near each point $b_k$: Choosing coordinates for which $b_k\in U_\alpha$ is the origin, we have $(u_0)_\alpha(x) =  e^{if(x)}x/|x|$ for some smooth function $f$ defined on a neighborhood of the origin.
\end{rmk}

 Next we describe the set of canonical harmonic sections. Let $u_0$ be a section of modulus 1 satisfying the degree $+1$ condition about the points $b_1,\ldots,b_d$ as given by the previous lemma and let $u$ be a canonical harmonic section. Then $u/u_0$ is a well-defined smooth function $v$ from $\M$ to the unit circle in $\mC$. 

If $\eta$ is the differential of the phase of $u/u_0$, then it is a closed one-form on $\M$. The  integral of $\eta$ along any closed path --- or, equivalently, along paths $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_g$ which generate $\pi_1(\M,\mZ)$ ---  belongs to  $2\pi\mZ$. We will say that $\eta$ has fluxes in $2\pi\mZ$.

It follows that the  one-form $$\omega=d\theta-A$$ on $\M\backslash\{b_1,\ldots,b_d\}$ that corresponds to $u$ is equal to $ \omega_0 + \eta$. Here $\omega_0$ is the form corresponding to $u_0$ (which is singular at the $b_k$'s) and $\eta$ is closed and has fluxes in $2\pi\mZ$. Moreover, from  \eqref{canonical} and \eqref{psibd}, we have that $\lambda := \omega - *d\psi_{b,d}$ is harmonic. Therefore, since $\eta = \lambda + *d\psi_{b,d} - \omega_0$ we deduce that  $\omega$ belongs to 
\begin{equation}\label{omegabd}\Omega_{b,d} := \left\{*d\psi_{b,d} + \lambda\mid\text{$\lambda$ is harmonic and $\lambda + *d\psi_{b,d} - \omega_0$ has integer fluxes.}\right\}.\end{equation}
Reciprocally, if $\omega=*d\psi_{b,d} + \lambda\in\Omega_{b,d}$, then $\eta = \lambda + *d\psi_{b,d} - \omega_0$ has integer fluxes and is closed from \eqref{psibd} and \eqref{canonical} using the fact that $\lambda$ is harmonic. Therefore $\eta$ is the differential of the phase of some smooth $v:\M\to\mC$ of modulus one, and we can readily check that $u = u_0 v$ is a canonical harmonic section. 

We recover the description of \cite{IgnatJerrard} by considering a set $\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_{2g}$ of generators of $\pi_1(\M)$ and their Poincaré duals  $\eta_1,\dots,\eta_{2g}$ which generate $H^1(\M)$, where $g$ is the genus of $\M$. If we choose $\eta_1,\dots,\eta_{2g}$ to be harmonic, then any harmonic one-form $\eta$ is of the form $\sum_k \Phi_k \eta_k + df$ for some harmonic function $f$ and from the definition of the Poincaré dual, $\int_{\gamma_\ell}\eta = \langle \eta,\eta_\ell\rangle$. Therefore we have reproved part of Theorem 2.1 in \cite{IgnatJerrard}.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:1} Let as above $\eta_1,\dots,\eta_{2g}$ be harmonic Poincaré duals of a set of simple closed curves which generate $H^1(\M)$ and $\omega_0 = -i {u_0}^{-1} d_A u_0$ for some section $u_0$ of modulus one satisfying the degree $+1$ condition about the points $b_1,\ldots,b_d$.

Then a  one-form $\omega$ corresponds to a canonical harmonic section satisfying the degree conditions about the points $b_1,\ldots,b_d$ if and only if 
\[\omega=*d\psi_{b,d}+\sum_{k=1}^{2g}\Phi_k\eta_k+df,\]
where $f:\M\to\mathbb{R}$ is harmonic, where $\psi_{b,d}$ is defined in \eqref{psibd}, and where for each $k$ the coefficient $\Phi_k$ satisfies the condition
\begin{equation}\label{lattice}\sum_{1\le l\le 2g} a_{k\ell}\Phi_\ell-\zeta_k\in 2\pi\mathbb Z,\end{equation}
with 
\[a_{k,\ell}= \langle \eta_k,\eta_\ell\rangle,\quad \zeta_k = \langle\omega_0 - *d\psi_{b,d}, \eta_k\rangle.\]
\end{prop}

\section{Proof of Theorem 1}

Step 1 : First we compute an upper-bound for minimizers of $E_\eps$. The construction differs from that in section 9.2 of \cite{IgnatJerrard} only in that the bundle may be different than the tangent bundle of $\M$. We only sketch it. Consider points $b_1,\dots,b_d$, and a canonical harmonic section $v$ of $\L$ of modulus one with singularities of degree $1$ at each of the points. Outside $\cup_k B(b_k,\sqrt\eps)$ we let $u_\eps = v$. Near a point $b_k\in U_\alpha$, we use exponential coordinates $x$ on $\M$ centered at $b_k$. With a slight abuse of notation, we denote by $v_\alpha$ the trivialization of $v$ in the patch $U_\alpha$, expressed in exponential coordinates.

Then, following the argument in \cite{IgnatJerrard}, we deduce the  behavior for $v_\alpha$ near $b_k$:
$$v_\alpha(x) = e^{i(\theta+\eta_k(x))},$$
where $\eta_k$ is a $C^1$ real-valued function defined in a neighborhood of the origin and $\theta$ is the polar angle in $\mR^2$.

This behavior allows us to glue $v_\alpha$ defined outside $B(b_k,\sqrt\eps)$ with the map $u_0(x/\eps)$ defined inside the ball, where $u_0$ is the standard radial vortex (see for example \cite{BBH}). This will require an interpolation on the annulus $B(b_k,2\sqrt\eps)\setminus B(b_k,\sqrt\eps)$, but this layer adds only $o(1)$ to the energy of the resulting test map $v_\eps$, as $\eps\to 0$.

We have, neglecting the interpolation layer,  
$$E_\eps(v_\eps,\M\setminus\cup_k B(b_k,\sqrt\eps)) = \pi d \log\frac1{\sqrt\eps} + \tilde E[v,b_1,\dots,b_d] + o(1),$$
from \eqref{Wdefn}.
On the other hand, from the well-known properties of the radial vortex we have
$$E_\eps(v_\eps,\cup_k B(b_k,\sqrt\eps) = \pi d \log\frac{\sqrt{\eps}}{\eps} + d\gamma + o(1),$$
where $\gamma$ is defined in \cite{BBH}.
Adding these estimates, we find that 
$$E_\eps(v_\eps) = \pi d \log\frac1{\eps} + \tilde E[v,b_1,\dots,b_d] + o(1).$$
Minimizing over all canonical harmonic sections $v$  with singularities of degree one about the points $b_1,\ldots,b_d$, we find that a minimizer $u_\eps$ of $E_\eps$ must satisfy, as $\eps\to 0$, 
$$E_\eps[u_\eps]\le\pi d\log{\frac{1}{\eps}}+d\gamma+W(b_1,\ldots,b_d)+o(1),$$
for any choice of $b_1,\dots,b_d$.

\medskip
Step 2 : Compactness. 

 Next, one couples the lower bound obtained through the ball construction of \cite{Jer99} and \cite{San98}, adapted to the present manifold setting, e.g., in \cite{IgnatJerrard}, and the upper bound from Step~1. It follows that, modulo a subsequence, there exist points $a_1,\dots,a_n\in\M$ such that $u_\eps$ converges in  $H^1_\mathrm{loc}$  outside $a_1,\dots,a_n$ to some $u_*$. Moreover,
 \begin{equation}
     \label{eq:balls}
     E_\eps(u_\eps,\cup_k B(a_k,\eta)\ge \pi d\log\frac\eta\eps  - C,
 \end{equation}
for any $\eta>0$, where $C$ is independent of $\eps$ and $\eta$. It follows that $u_*$ is a section of modulus $1$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{etabound}E_0(u_*,\M\setminus\cup_k B(a_j,\eta)):= \frac12\int_{\M\setminus\cup_k B(a_j,\eta)}|d_Au_*|^2\le \pi d\log\frac1\eta +C.\end{equation}
On the other hand, since $u_\eps$ is a critical point of $E_\eps$ we have $d^*\omega_\eps = 0$, where $\omega_\eps = iu_\eps\cdot d_Au_\eps$. Passing to the limit, we find that $\omega_* = iu_*\cdot d_Au_*$ satisfies $d^*\omega_* = 0$. But outside the points we have $|u_*| = 1$ and $\omega_* = d\theta_* - A,$ so that $d\omega_* = -dA$. Thus 
$$\text{$d^*\omega_* = 0$ and $d\omega_* = -dA$ on $\M\setminus\cup_j B(a_j,\eta)$.}$$

Step 3 : We now check what happens at the points $a_1,\dots,a_n$. From \eqref{eq:balls}, the energy inside the balls of radius $\eta$ and centered at $a_1,\dots,a_n$ is $\pi d \log\eta/\eps - C$. Then, for $u_*$ the energy in the annuli $B(a_j,\sqrt\eta)\setminus B(a_j,\eta)$ is at least $\frac12\pi\sum_j {d_j}^2|\log\eta|$ (cf. \cite{San98}). From the upper bound, taking $\eta$ small we find $\sum_j {d_j}^2 = d$, hence $n=d$ and $d_j = 1$ for every $j$. 

From the analog of \eqref{etabound} applied to the annulus $\A_\eta:=B(a_j,\sqrt\eta)\setminus B(a_j,\eta)$ we have that, for any $j$, 
\begin{equation}\label{annulusbound}E_0(u_*,B(a_j,\sqrt\eta)\setminus B(a_j,\eta))\le \pi\log\frac{\sqrt\eta}\eta + C.\end{equation}
We choose one of the points $a_j\in U_\alpha$ and let $u = (u_*)_\alpha = e^{i\theta_*}$. We choose exponential coordinates on $\M$ around $a$, and let $(r,\theta)$ be the corresponding polar coordinates, and $\omega_{a_l} = d\theta - A$. Then, using \eqref{annulusbound} and the fact that $u_*$ has degree one at $a_j$, we obtain
$$\int_{\A_\eta}|\omega_* - \omega_{a_j}|^2 = \int_{\A_\eta}|\omega_*|^2 - \int_{\A_\eta}|\omega_{a_j}|^2 +O(1)\le C.$$

Next, we choose a $C^\infty$-cutoff function $\varphi$ equal to $1$ on $B(a_k,\eta)$ and $0$ outside $B(a_k,\sqrt\eta),$ such that 
$$\int_{\A_\eta}|d\varphi|^2\le\frac C{|\log\eta|}. $$
Then, integrating by parts,
$$\int_{\M} (d\omega_* - d\omega_{a_j})\varphi = \int_{\A_\eta} (\omega_* - \omega_{a_j})\wedge d\varphi\le \|\omega_* - \omega_{a_j}\|_{L^2(\A_\eta)}\|d\varphi\|_{L^2(\A_\eta)}\le \frac C{|\log\eta|}.$$
Since in a neighborhood of $a_j$ we have $d\omega_{a_j} = 2\pi\delta_{a_k}d\vol-dA$, by letting $\eta\to 0$ we deduce that the part of $d\omega_*$ supported at the singleton $\{a_j\}$ is precisely  $2\pi\delta_{a_j}d\vol$. We conclude similarly that $\{a_j\}$ lies outside of the support of $d^*\omega_*$, and finally that 
$$\text{$d^*\omega_* = 0$ and $d\omega_* = 2\pi\left(\sum_j\delta_{a_j}\right)d\vol-dA$.}$$
Therefore $u_*$ is a canonical harmonic section. 

Step 4 : Lower bound up to $o(1)$ with the renormalized energy. Consider a subsequence, not relabeled, such that $u_\eps$ converges to $u_*$ in $C^1_{\loc}(\M\setminus\{a_1,\dots,a_d\})$. In a neighborhood of $a_j$ in a patch $U_\alpha$ we have $u_{*,\alpha} = e^{i\theta_{j,\alpha}}$, where the phase $\theta_{j,\alpha}$ is defined modulo $2\pi$ and is harmonic on $U_\alpha$. We choose exponential coordinates in a neighborhood of $a_j$, so that $a_j$ corresponds to the origin and the metric at the origin is the identity matrix.

Then, in these coordinates, $u_{*,\alpha}(x) \approx x/|x|$ on $\partial B_\rho(0)$ as $\rho\to 0$. Therefore, as in \cite{BBH} and \cite{IgnatJerrard}, choosing $\rho>0$ small enough,  
\begin{equation}\label{low1} \liminf_{\eps\to 0} \left(E_\eps(u_\eps,B_\rho(a_j)) - \pi\log\frac\rho\eps\right)\ge \gamma + o_\rho(1),\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is defined as in \cite{BBH}. 

On the other hand, by definition of the renormalized energy in \eqref{Wdefn}, we have 
\begin{equation}\label{low2}\frac{1}{2}\int_{\M\backslash\cup_{j=1}^d B_\rho(a_j)}|\nabla_A u_*|^2\ge \tilde{E}[u_*,a_1,\ldots,a_d]+ \pi d\log\frac1{\rho} + o_\rho(1).\end{equation}
Combining \eqref{low1} and \eqref{low2}, we find that,
$$\liminf_{\eps\to 0}\left( E_\eps(u_\eps) - \pi d\log\frac1\eps\right)\ge  d\gamma + \tilde{E}[u_*,a_1,\ldots,a_d].$$
Combining with step 1, we get the desired result.

\section{The renormalized energy}
\label{sec:W}
In this section we compute a more explicit formula for the renormalized energy $W$.  
\begin{definition} We define the lattice $\LL(b_1,\dots,b_d)\subset \mR^{2g}$ to be the set of vectors $$(\Phi_1,\dots,\Phi_{2g})$$ such that \eqref{lattice} holds.
The function $G(x,y)$ is the solution to 
$$- \Delta G(\cdot,y) = \delta_y - \frac1{\vol(\M)}.$$
The regular part of $G$ is 
$$H(x,y) = G(x,y)  + \frac1{2\pi} \log(\dist_\M(x,y)),$$
where $\dist_\M$ denotes the intrinsic distance on $\M$.

The function $\psi_0$ is the solution of 
$$- \Delta \psi_0 = -\kappa + \bar \kappa,\quad \bar\kappa = \frac1{\vol(\M)}\int_\M \kappa,$$
where $\kappa = *dA$ is the curvature of the connection $A$.
\end{definition}
\begin{prop}\label{explicit}
Given any $\vec b = (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_d)\in \M^d$, 
$$W(b_1,\ldots,b_d) = \inf_{\Phi\in\LL(\vec b)} W(b_1,\ldots,b_d,\Phi),$$
where 
\begin{align}
W(b_1,\ldots,b_d,\Phi)& = 4\pi^2\sum_{1\le i<j\le d} G(b_i,b_j)\nonumber \\ &+ 2\pi \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\pi H(b_i,b_i) +\psi_0(b_i)\right) +\frac12|\Phi|^2 +\int_\M \frac{|d\psi_0|^2}{2}.\label{Wdefn2}
\end{align}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    The renormalized energy $W$ is defined in Theorem~1 as the infimum of $\tilde{E}[v,b_1,\ldots,b_d]$ given in \eqref{Wdefn}, where $v$ is a canonical harmonic section.

    These canonical harmonic sections, modulo multiplication by a constant phase, are in one-to-one correspondence with the fluxes $\Phi\in\LL(b_1,\ldots,b_d)$.

    The value of \eqref{Wdefn} for the canonical harmonic section corresponding to fluxes $\Phi$ was computed in \cite{IgnatJerrard} and is precisely  $W(b_1,\ldots,b_d,\Phi)$ defined above. Note that in this computation, only the one-form $\omega$ is involved and therefore it is irrelevant whether it is obtained from a section of a bundle $\L$ (in our case) or a tangent vector field on $\M$ (as is the case in \cite{IgnatJerrard}). The only difference is that in our case $\kappa$ is the curvature of the connection $A$ whereas it was the Gauss curvature of $\M$ in \cite{IgnatJerrard}, i.e. the curvature of the Levi-Civita connection on the tangent bundle of $\M$.  
\end{proof}

\section{Higher rank tensor bundles over surfaces}
\label{sec:high}


In this section we describe a family of complex line bundles $\L_k$, one for each Euler number $k = e(\L_k) \geq 2$, to which our previous work can be applied.  We first introduce some standard facts about tensor products of copies of $\R{2}$.  Then, we use this structure to describe the bundles $\L_k$.


Let $\{e_1, e_2\}$ be a fixed orthonormal basis for $\R{2}$ and $k \geq 2$ be an integer. We introduce $k$-tuples of vectors
\[e_{i_1},\ldots,e_{i_k}\]
drawn from the set $\{e_1, e_2\}$, where $i_j\in\{1,2\}$ for every $j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}.$ Considering all choices $\mu=\left\{i_1,\ldots,i_k\right\}$ of distinct arrangements of 1's and 2's, it is easy to show that the collection
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fmu}
    f_\mu:=e_{i_1}\otimes\ldots\otimes e_{i_k}
\end{equation}
forms a basis for $\otimes^k \R{2}:=\underbrace{\R{2}\otimes ... \otimes \R{2}}_\text{k \,\,\,\mbox{times}}.$ Further, the inner product of two elements of $\otimes^k \R{2}$ can be obtained by extending the expression 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle f_{\mu_1},f_{\mu_2}\right\rangle:=\Pi_{j=1}^k\left\langle e_{i_j^1},e_{i_j^2}\right\rangle \label{inner_prod}
\end{equation}
for the inner product between the elements of the basis.

For $\sigma \in S_k$, where $S_k$ is the group of permutations in $k$ indices, define the permutation operator
$$
T_\sigma : \otimes^k \R{2} \to \otimes^k \R{2}
$$
by extending by linearity to the entire $\otimes^k \R{2}$ the action
$$
T_\sigma(f_\mu) = e_{i_{\sigma(1)}}\otimes ... \otimes e_{i_{\sigma(k)}}
$$
of $T_\sigma$ on the elements of the basis of $\otimes^k \R{2}$. Then we can define
\begin{equation}\label{def:sym_tensors}
\otimes^k_{sym} \R{2} = \{\mathcal{Q}\in \otimes^k\R{2} : \,\,\,  T_\sigma(\mathcal{Q}) = \mathcal{Q} \,\,\, \mbox{for all}\,\,\,  \sigma \in S_k\},
\end{equation}
which will be referred to as the set of symmetric $k$-tensors on $\R{2}$.
%Lastly, the operator
%\begin{equation}
%S := \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma \in S_k} T_\sigma \label{projection}
%\end{equation}
%is a projection from $\otimes^k E$ onto $\otimes^k_{sym}E$.  If $E$ has an inner product and $\otimes^k E$ has the inner product defined by \eqref{inner_prod}, then the operator $S$ represents the orthogonal projection from $\otimes^k E$ onto $\otimes^k_{sym}E$.
% For $I \subset \{1, ..., k\}$, define
% $$
% f(j,I) = \left \{  \begin{array}{cc} e_1 & j \in I \\ e_2 & j \notin I \end{array} \right., \,\,\,  j=1, ..., k.
% $$
% The collection
% $$
% \{f(1, I) \otimes ... \otimes f(k, I) : \,\,\,  I \subset \{1, ..., k\}\}
% $$
% is a basis for $\otimes^k E$.
%%Now let $\mu=\left\{i_1,\ldots,i_k\right\}$ be a $k$-tuple with values in $\{1,2\}$ and consider all distinct permutations $\sigma\in S_k$ of the elements of $\mu$. 
% Let now $0 \leq j \leq k$ and set
% $$
% D(k, j) = \{I \subset \{1, ..., k\}:  \,\,\, \mbox{the cardinality of}\,\,\, I \,\,\, \mbox{is}\,\,\, j \}.
% $$
A basis for $\otimes^k_{sym}\R{2}$ is the collection
% $$
% \left \{h(k, j) = \sum_{I \in D(k, j)} f(1, I) \otimes ... \otimes f(k, I), \,\,\, j=0, ..., k \right \}.
% $$
\begin{equation}\label{def:basis_sym_tensors}
\sum_{\sigma} f_{\sigma(\mu)},
\end{equation}
for all {\it non-decreasing} $k$-tuples $\mu$ with values in $\{1,2\}$. One can identify each element of this basis through the number of 1's in $\mu,$ hence for each $j\in\{0,\ldots,k\},$ we can define
$$h(k,j)=\sum_{\sigma} f_{\sigma(\mu)},$$
where $\mu$ is the non-decreasing $k$-tuple with values in $\{1,2\}$ that begins with exactly $j$ entries equal to $1$. It immediately follows that $\otimes^k_{sym}\R{2}$ has dimension $k+1$.


% An alternative basis for $\otimes^k_{sym} E$ is the collection
% $$
% \left \{  S(\otimes^j e_1 \otimes \otimes^{k-j} e_2) : \,\,\,  j=0, ..., k \right \},
% $$
% where $S$ is the operator defined by equation \eqref{projection}.  In fact, the vectors in the second list are multiples of those in the first.

We now define the trace operator
$$
{\rm{tr}}_{12} : \otimes^k\R{2} \to \otimes^{k-2}\R{2},
$$
which is the contraction with respect to the first two indices: 
$$
{\rm{tr}}_{12}(v_1\otimes ... \otimes v_k) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\langle v_1, v_2\rangle \left(v_3\otimes ... \otimes v_k\right), & k> 2,\\\langle v_1, v_2\rangle, & k=2.\end{array}\right.
$$
Note that for $k \geq 2$, if $\mathcal{Q}\in \otimes^k_{sym}\R{2}$, then ${\rm{tr_{12}}}(\mathcal{Q}) \in \otimes^{k-2}_{sym}\R{2}$.  We will also define the space of symmetric, traceless tensors in $\R{2}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{def:sym_tr_tensors}
\otimes^k_{sym, tr} \R{2} = \{ \mathcal{Q}\in \otimes^k_{sym} : {\rm tr}_{12}(\mathcal{Q}) = 0\}.
\end{equation}

\medskip
\medskip

Furthermore, relative to the bases $\{h(k, j)\}_{j=0}^k$ and $\{h(k-2, j)\}_{j=0}^{k-2}$, for $\otimes^k_{sym}\R{2}$ and $\otimes^{k-2}_{sym}\R{2},$ respectively, the $(k-1)\times (k+1)$ matrix corresponding to the mapping $\rm{tr}_{12}$ is ${\left(\rm{tr}_{12}\right)}_{ij}=\delta_{i,j}+\delta_{i,j-2}.$ Note that the operator $\rm{tr}_{12} : \otimes^k_{sym}\R{2} \to \otimes^{k-2}_{sym}\R{2}$ is onto and so by the Kernel-Image theorem, $\rm{ker}(\rm{tr}_{12})$ has dimension  $2.$ Hence, it is easy to verify that a basis for this space is given by two tensors
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{Q}_o(k) = \sum_{1 \leq 2i+1 \leq k} (-1)^i h(k, 2i+1), \,\,\,  \mathcal{Q}_e(k) = \sum_{0 \leq 2i \leq k} (-1)^i h(k, 2i).\label{basis_sym_trace}
\end{equation}
Further, when $k \geq 2$, one can check that
\begin{align}
\mathcal{Q}_o(k+1) &= e_1 \otimes \mathcal{Q}_e(k) + e_2 \otimes \mathcal{Q}_o(k), \nonumber\\
\mathcal{Q}_e(k+1) &= -e_1 \otimes \mathcal{Q}_o(k) + e_2 \otimes \mathcal{Q}_e(k), \label{tensor_growth}
\end{align}
and
$$
\langle \mathcal{Q}_o , \mathcal{Q}_e\rangle = 0, \,\,\, \langle \mathcal{Q}_o , \mathcal{Q}_o\rangle = \langle \mathcal{Q}_e , \mathcal{Q}_e\rangle.
$$
In terms of our discussion so far, we define the set $\otimes^k_{sym,tr} \R{2}$ of rank-$k$, symmetric, traceless tensors in $\R{2}$ as the kernel of the operator $\rm{tr}_{12}$ in $\otimes^k_{sym} \R{2}$.

Next, given $0 \leq \alpha < 2\pi$, define the rotation matrix 
$$
R_\alpha = \left (  \begin{array}{cc} \cos{\alpha} & -\sin{\alpha} \\ \sin{\alpha} & \cos{\alpha} \end{array}\right )
$$
by $\alpha$ in $\R{2}$. Recall that for a linear map $T: \R{2} \to \R{2}$, we can define $\otimes^k T : \otimes^k \R{2} \to \otimes^k \R{2}$ by the condition
$$
(\otimes^k T)(v_1\otimes ... \otimes v_k) = (Tv_1) \otimes ... \otimes (Tv_k).
$$
We have the following lemma.
\begin{lem} The action of $\otimes^k R_\alpha$ on $\rm{ker}(\rm{tr}_{12})$ is determined by
$$
(\otimes^k R_\alpha)(\mathcal{Q}_o(k)) = \cos(k\alpha) \mathcal{Q}_o(k) + \sin(k\alpha) \mathcal{Q}_e(k)
$$
and
$$
(\otimes^k R_\alpha)(\mathcal{Q}_e(k)) = -\sin(k\alpha) \mathcal{Q}_o(k) + \cos(k\alpha) \mathcal{Q}_e(k).
$$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
The proof is straightforward for the case $k=2$.  For $k \geq 2$, the conclusion follows by induction using equations \eqref{tensor_growth}.

\end{proof}
We remark that when $k=2,$ the set $\otimes^2_{sym, tr}\R{2}$ is precisely the set of $Q$-tensors in $\R{2}$. 

\medskip

Next, let $\M$ be a closed, compact, orientable surface embedded in $\R{3}$.  We denote by $\nu$ the globally defined normal to $\M$.  We will use the usual notation $T\M$ and $T_p\M$ for the tangent bundle of $\M$ and the tangent to $\M$ at $p \in \M$, respectively.  It is a standard fact that the inner product and Levi-Civita connection from $\R{3}$ induce a Riemannian metric, and corresponding Levi-Civita connection, in $T\M$.  This turns $T\M$ into a Riemannian vector bundle with a metric connection, which we denote by $\nabla$.

We assume throughout this section the existence of a simple cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of $\M$ such that for each $\alpha$ there is a pair of orthonormal sections $e_j^\alpha : U_\alpha \to T\M$, $j=1, 2$ and that $\{e_1^\alpha, e_2^\alpha, \nu\}$ is a positively oriented basis in $\R{3}$.
Since $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection for $\M,$ there exists a $1$-form $A_\alpha$, over $U_\alpha$ that satisfies
$$
\nabla_X e_1^\alpha = A_\alpha(X) e_2^\alpha, \,\,\, \nabla_X e_2^\alpha = -A_\alpha(X)e_1^\alpha.
$$
Recall that while $A_\alpha$ is not globally defined, $dA_\alpha$ is a globally defined $2$-form.

For $k \geq 2$ we denote by $T^k\M$ the vector bundle over $\M$ with a fiber $\otimes^k T_p\M$ over $p \in\M$.  Note that the bundle projection $\Pi_k : T^k \M \to \M$ can be defined in the obvious way for every $k \geq 2$.  It is standard to extend the Riemannian metric and connection from $T\M$ to $T^k\M$, so that $T^k\M$ is also a Riemannian vector bundle with a metric connection.  Furthermore, it is routine to check that the definitions of $\otimes^k_{sym} \R{2}$ and $\otimes^k_{sym,tr} \R{2}$ extend naturally to define the bundles $T^k_{sym}\M$ of symmetric rank-$k$ tensors and $T^k_{sym,tr} \M$ of symmetric, traceless, rank-$k$ tensors over $\M$, respectively.  These are also Riemannian bundles with a metric connection, and we will take $\L_k = T^k_{sym,tr} \M$.  These constructions are standard, and the remaining work is devoted to showing that $\L_k$ is a complex line bundle, or equivalently, a rank-2 real vector bundle, and to computing the Euler number of $\L_k$.

If $\{U_\alpha\}$ is a simple cover of $\M$, then for each $\alpha$ there is a pair of orthonormal sections $e_j^\alpha : U_\alpha \to T\M$, $j=1, 2.$ Generalizing \eqref{eq:fmu}, we introduce maps
$f^\alpha_\mu: U_\alpha \to T^k\M,$ where $f^\alpha_\mu$ denote a set of orthonormal sections over $U_\alpha$ with values in $T^k\M$. At each $p \in \M$, these sections span the fiber of $T^k \M$ over $p$. This allows us to define local trivializations
$$
\Phi_\alpha : \Pi_k^{-1}(U_\alpha) \to U_\alpha \times \otimes^k \R{2}
$$
by setting
$$
\Phi_\alpha(p, f^\alpha_\mu) = (p, f_\mu).
$$
If $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \neq \emptyset$, as before, there is a transition function $\varphi_{\alpha\beta} \to \R{}$ such that
$$
e_1^\beta=\cos{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} e_1^\alpha + \sin{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} e_2^\alpha \,\,\, \mbox{and} \,\,\, e_2^\beta=-\sin{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} e_1^\alpha + \cos{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} e_2^\alpha.
$$
Let
$$
R_{\alpha\beta} = R_{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}}= \left (  \begin{array}{cc} \cos{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} & -\sin{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} \\ \sin{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}} & \cos{\varphi_{\alpha\beta}}
\end{array}\right ).
$$
For the trivializations above, the transition maps
$$
\Phi_\beta \circ \Phi_\alpha^{-1} : (U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \times \otimes^k \R{2} \to (U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \times \otimes^k \R{2}
$$
are given by
$$
(\Phi_\beta \circ \Phi_\alpha^{-1})(p, \mathcal{Q}) = (p, (\otimes^k R_{\alpha\beta})(\mathcal{Q})).
$$
Next, we observe $T^k\M$ becomes a Riemannian vector bundle if we endow its fibers with the inner product defined in \eqref{inner_prod}.  Further, it is standard to use Leibnitz rule to furnish $T^k\M$ with a metric connection, that we still denote by $\nabla$.  This defines $T^k\M$.




\medskip
\medskip

We now point out that the the constructions that yielded the spaces $\otimes^k_{sym} \R{2}$ and $\otimes^k_{sym, tr} \R{2}$, defined in \eqref{def:sym_tensors} and \eqref{def:sym_tr_tensors} respectively, can be applied to $T^k\M$ to define the bundles $T^k_{sym}\M$ and $T^k_{sym, tr}\M$.  It is easy to check that we can use the orthonormal sections $e_j^\alpha : U_\alpha \to T\M$, $j=1, 2$ to define constant multiples of orthonormal sections
$$
\sum_{\sigma} f_{\sigma(\mu)}^\alpha
$$
and
$$
\mathcal{Q}_o^\alpha, \mathcal{Q}_e^\alpha
$$
in $U_\alpha$, with values in $T^k_{sym}\M$ and $T^k_{sym, tr}\M$ respectively.  It is straightforward to define trivializations for $T^k_{sym}\M$ and $T^k_{sym, tr}\M$ over $U_\alpha$, starting from the sections we just described.  From the constructions in \eqref{def:sym_tensors} and \eqref{def:sym_tr_tensors}, we conclude that $T^k_{sym}\M$ is a rank-$(k+1)$ real vector bundle over $\M$, whereas $T^k_{sym, tr}\M$ is a rank-$2$ vector bundle over $\M$, or equivalently, a complex line bundle.


It is a matter of a simple calculation to show that the connection $\nabla$ from $T^k\M$ can be restricted to $T^k_{sym}\M$ to yield a metric connection in $T^k_{sym}\M$, and the same is true for $T^k_{sym, tr}\M$. We can now state the main result of this section.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:main}
For each $U_\alpha$, the tensors $\mathcal{Q}_o^\alpha(k)$ and $\mathcal{Q}_e^\alpha(k)$ given by \eqref{basis_sym_trace} form an orthogonal frame for $T^k_{sym, tr}\M$ in $U_\alpha$, and they have the same constant length, that depends only on $k$, and not on $\alpha$. Furthermore, in each $U_\alpha,$ we also have
$$
\nabla_X \mathcal{Q}_o^\alpha = k \,A_\alpha(X)\,\mathcal{Q}_e^\alpha, \,\,\, \nabla_X \mathcal{Q}_e^\alpha = -k \,A_\alpha(X)\,\mathcal{Q}_o^\alpha.
$$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Most of the Lemma is already proved in the previous section.  The claim about the covariant derivatives of $\mathcal{Q}_o$, $\mathcal{Q}_e$ follows from \eqref{tensor_growth} by induction in $k$.
\end{proof}
The final proposition is a corollary of Lemma \eqref{lem:main}.
\begin{prop}
\label{prop:porp}
    The Euler number of the bundle of symmetric, traceless, rank-$k$ tensors over $\M$ is given by
    $$ e(T^k_{sym,tr}\M) = 2k e(T\M).$$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
From Lemma~\eqref{lem:main}, and since  $\mathcal{Q}_o$, $\mathcal{Q}_e$ is (a constant multiple of) an orthonormal frame, the curvature of $\nabla_X$ on $T^k_{sym,tr}\M$ is $k$ times that of $\nabla_X$ on $T\M$. We conclude by integrating curvature over $\M$ (cf. \cite{MR3585539}).
\end{proof}
When $\M=\mathbb S^2$ we immediately obtain
\begin{cor}
    The Euler number of $T^k_{sym,tr}\mathbb S^2$ is  $2k$.
\end{cor}

Before concluding this section, we remark that alternatively, if one views the tangent planes $T\M_p$ at different points $p\in\M$ as one-dimensional complex lines rather than two-dimensional real planes, then this provides a different but equivalent description of the line bundles $T^k_{sym,tr}\M$, \cite{Hall}. However, because our work is inspired by applications in soft matter and meshing, we choose here to present our work in the context of real vector spaces rather than complex. 

\section{Proof of Theorem 2}

Here we consider the case where $\M=\mathbb{S}^2$, where $\L$ is the rank-$k,$ symmetric, traceless tensor bundle over $\mathbb S^2$, and where the connection $A$ is the Levi-Civita connection on $\L$. The curvature of $A$ is then constant $\kappa = 2k$.

By Proposition \eqref{prop:porp}, the Euler number of $\L$ is equal to $2k$ and, since $\mathbb S^2$ is simply connected, there is a unique canonical harmonic section associated to singularities $(b_1,\dots,b_{2k})$. Furthermore, the lattice $\LL(b_1,\dots,b_{2k})$, being of dimension $2g$, degenerates to $\{0\}$ since the genus of the sphere is $g=0$. 

Moreover,  the Green's function is given by
$$G(x,y) =  -\frac1{2\pi}\log(\abs{x-y}),$$
where $\abs{x-y}$ is the Euclidean distance between two points in $\mathbb{R}^3$. As a consequence of these observations, formula \eqref{Wdefn} reduces in this case to
$$W(a) = -2\pi\sum_{1\le i<j\le 4}\log|a_i-a_j|.$$

Then Theorem \ref{tetra} follows from \cite{MR2257398}, Theorem 1.2, since the logarithm is a completely monotonic function.

\section{Tangent and $Q$-tensor bundles over a surface}\label{Qtensors}
Let us now specialize to the tangent bundle of $\M$ and its $Q$-tensor bundle. In the case of the tangent bundle, a section is a vector field $\tau$. The trivializations are obtained via orthonormal frames $\{(\tau_1^\alpha,\tau_1^\alpha)\}_\alpha$ defined on the patches of the cover. On each patch such a frame exists since the patches are simply-connected. Then on $U_\alpha$ we may write $\tau = x_\alpha \tau_1^\alpha + y_\alpha \tau_2^\alpha$, where $x_\alpha$ and $y_\alpha$ are real-valued functions on $U_\alpha$. 

Then the trivializations of $\tau$ are the maps $\tau_\alpha = x_\alpha + i y_\alpha$. 

Similarly, a $Q$-tensor field $Q$ is a linear combination of $Q_1^\alpha$ and $Q_2^\alpha$ on $U_\alpha$, where 
$$Q_1^\alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\tau_1^\alpha \otimes \tau_1^\alpha - \tau_2^\alpha \otimes \tau_2^\alpha),\quad Q_2^\alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\tau_1^\alpha \otimes \tau_2^\alpha + \tau_2^\alpha \otimes \tau_1^\alpha).$$
Therefore we have $Q = x_\alpha Q_1^\alpha + y_\alpha Q_2^\alpha$ on $U_\alpha$ and the trivializations of $Q$ are the maps $Q_\alpha = x_\alpha + i y_\alpha$.

On  both the tangent and $Q$-tensor bundles there is an inner product, from which a natural connection called the Levi-Civita connection is deduced by enforcing the requirement that for any sections $\lambda$ and $\mu$ it should hold that 
$$d\langle\lambda,\mu\rangle = \langle d_A\lambda,\mu\rangle + \langle \lambda,d_A\mu\rangle.$$

In the case of the tangent bundle, using the fact that  $(\tau_1^\alpha,\tau_1^\alpha)$ is an orthonormal frame, this implies that on a patch $U_\alpha$ we have 
\begin{equation}\label{conform}
    d_A \tau_1^\alpha = \omega_{12}^\alpha  \tau_2^\alpha ,\quad d_A \tau_2^\alpha  = -\omega_{12}^\alpha  \tau_1^\alpha ,\end{equation} 
{\color{Periwinkle} for some real-valued 1-form $\omega_{12}^\alpha$. Note that $\omega_{12}^\alpha = \omega_{12}^\beta$ on $U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ so that $\omega_{12}$ is in fact a globally defined 2-form on $\M$.

Then, since $(\tau_1^\alpha )_\alpha = 1$, we have from \eqref{covdev} and \eqref{conform} 
$$(d_A\tau_1^\alpha)_\alpha = -i A_\alpha,\quad (d_A\tau_1^\alpha)_\alpha  = (\omega_{12}  \tau_2^\alpha)_\alpha = i \omega_{12},$$
so that in this case $A_\alpha = - \omega_{12} $. 

The case of the $Q$-tensor bundle is easily deduced since for the Levi-Civita connection, the covariant derivative obeys the Leibniz rule with respect to the tensor product. Thus we have 
$$d_A Q_1^\alpha  = \frac1{\sqrt 2} \left(d_A\tau_1^\alpha \otimes \tau_1^\alpha - d_A\tau_2^\alpha \otimes \tau_2^\alpha + \tau_1^\alpha \otimes d_A\tau_1^\alpha - \tau_2^\alpha \otimes d_A\tau_2^\alpha\right),$$
and a similar formula for $d_A Q_2^\alpha$, from which we deduce
$$d_A Q_1^\alpha  = 2\omega_{12} Q_2^\alpha ,\quad d_A Q_2^\alpha  = -2\omega_{12} Q_2^\alpha.$$
Thus in this case we have $A_\alpha = - 2\omega_{12}$. }Therefore
\begin{prop}
    Assume that $\M$ is a closed surface, denote by $T\M$ its tangent bundle and by $Q\M$ the $Q$-tensor bundle over $\M$. Then 
    $$ e(Q\M) = 2 e(T\M),$$
    where $e(Q\M)$ is the Euler number of the bundle $Q\M$ and $e(T\M)$ is  the Euler number of the bundle $T\M$, also called the Euler characteristic of $\M$.
\end{prop}
{\color{red} Alberto will do this.}
\begin{proof}
{\color{Periwinkle}    Using the notations above, the curvature of a connection on $Q\M$ is $-2\omega_{12}$, while the curvature of a connection on $T\M$ is $-\omega_{12}$. Therefore, integrating we get the result.}
\end{proof}

Given the orthonormality of the basis $\left\{e_1^\alpha,e_2^\alpha\right\}$ we can reformulate \eqref{covdev} as follows:
$$
\nabla_X e_1^\alpha = A_\alpha(X) e_2^\alpha, \,\,\, \nabla_X e_2^\alpha = -A_\alpha(X) e_1^\alpha,
$$
w
